This week I 
* Wrote tests for isProbablyPrime method in prime-numbers.js
* Added a CI action that runs units tests on pushes and displays coverage reports.

Plans for next week:
* Refactor prime number generation
* Write more unit tests for prime number generation

I have roughly spent 2 hours on everything.

This week I 
* Made a first iteration of keys generation and encryption/decryption algorithms
* Wrote a simple integration test that verifies the message stays intact after being encrypted and decrypted

Plans for next week:
* Refactor encryption algorithms
* Implement handling of long messages
* Implement optimizations for Miller-Rabin test
* Write better unit tests for Miller-Rabin test
* Write unit tests for RSA.js

I have roughly spent 4 hours on everything.

This week I 
* Studied the suggested topics on the course page
* Chose Cryptography as my topic of interest and decided to make an implementation of RSA with JavaScript
* Created my GitHub repository for the project and signed up for the course on Labtool
* Filled out the [Specification Document](Documentation/Specification.md) and created a blank 
[Implementation Document](Documentation/Implementation.md).

I have roughly spent 1.5 hours on everything.

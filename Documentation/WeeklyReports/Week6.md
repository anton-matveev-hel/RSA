This week I 
* Optimized Miller-Rabin primality test by precomputing small primes
* Implemented handling of long messages

More plans:
* Refactor encryption algorithms
* Write better unit tests for Miller-Rabin test
* Write unit tests for RSA.js
* Implement a CLI

I have roughly spent 3 hours on everything.

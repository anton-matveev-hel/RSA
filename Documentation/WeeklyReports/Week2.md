This week I 
* Studied how RSA algorithm works
* Studied how to work with Big Integers in JavaScript
* Studied how to implement Miller-Rabin Test to check that a number is likely a prime
* Implemented the first iteration of prime number generation

Plans for next week:
* Refactor prime number generation
* Write unit tests for prime number generation
* Include test coverage reports into the project

I have roughly spent 4 hours on everything.
